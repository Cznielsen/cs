\section{Proof}
\label{sec-1}
Since $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are good representations, they must necessary run in polynomial time and since they are equivalent it is possible to reduce one of them from the other and vice versa. $f$ is a simple function that run in constant time (basically converts '1' to 'yes' and '0' to 'no'). Since:
\begin{itemize}
\item $L_1$ is based upon the functionality of $\pi_1$,
\item $f$ does the same in both languages,
\item $\pi_1 \leq \pi_2$ (per definition of being polynomially equivalent)
\end{itemize}
$L_1$ must also be reducible from $L_2$ and vice versa (i.e. $L_1 \leq L_2$. We know that $L_2 \in P$ as it was restricted by $\pi_2$ which is bounded by polynomial time and thus in $P$ as well. We can then finally use the property of  downward closure of $P$ on our languages:
\begin{equation*}
$L_1 \leq L_2 \wedge L_2 \in P \implies L_1 \in P$
\end{equation}
to make the implication that if $L_2$ is in $P$ then $L_1$ must also necessarily be in $P$ and vice versa. Similarly if $L_1 or L_2$ is not in $P$ (and $f$ is trivial), then the inner $\pi$-function is \emph{not} a good representation and both languages must not be in $P$ following the closure. This gives us that $L_1 \in P \Leftrightarrow L_2 \in P$, if $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are good representations. \square
