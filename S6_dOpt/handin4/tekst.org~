* First Part
For this part we must show that there exists an optimal solution in the set of the corner points of the unit cube.

The trick here is that we can show that the objective function is linear in all cases. The only place where it might be quadratic is the second term. Since $Q$ is defined to be $0$ on its diagonal, we can write the objective function as two sums:
\begin{equation*}
$\sum_i c_ix_i + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}q_{ij}x_ix_j$
\end{equation}
where each term in the sum where $i=j$ is $0$. This way, it cannot possibly become quadratic. \newline \newline
If we assume we are given an optimal solution $x \in [0, 1]^n$ where there are $k$ coordinates that aren't 
* Second Part
\begin{equation*}
$f(x)=-\sum_{i \in V}x_i + \sum_{(i,j) \in  E} n \cdot x_i x_j$
\end{equation}
For this proof we must show that $f(x) \geq 0$ when $S$ is not an independant set and that $f(x) = -|S|$ when $S$ /is/ an independant set.

Our equation $f(x)$ consists of two summation terms.
When $S$ is not independant we have to cases to work with: The first case is that the sets are empty and the resulting output is 0. The second case is when the rightmost sum of $f(x)$ must be at least $n$ as there must exists at least one connection between two vertices. Since $n$ is defined to be the size of $V$ and $S \subset V$, it must necessarily be bigger than the first term as $n+(-1) \geq 0$ always. \newline \newline
If $S$ is an independant set, there must be no edges between the vertices in the graph, which results in every term in the sum of the second term of $f(x)$ resulting in 0 (as there are no connections in an independant set). This leaves us with the first term, which is a sum of ones and zeros, where it is only incremented when a vertex is in the subset $S$. This results in the output being the negative size of $S$, which is exactly $-|S|$.
* Third Part
